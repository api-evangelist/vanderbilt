> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

Vanderbilt University is a private research university in Nashville, Tennessee, ranked #248 in the QS World University Rankings 2025. This repository catalogs Vanderbilt's public developer and API footprint as an [APIs.json](https://apisjson.org) profile. That footprint is limited and largely gated: Vanderbilt IT (VUIT) offers API integration and management services to faculty and staff behind an Azure API Management portal that does not resolve for the general public, while the Heard Libraries and Data Science Institute maintain open GitHub presences. No official, publicly documented, self-service Vanderbilt API was confirmed during review.

## APIs

- **Vanderbilt API Management Developer Portal** — Azure API Management portal for discovering APIs, acquiring keys, and trying APIs interactively. Appears internal/network-gated (did not resolve publicly during review). Docs: https://apim-portal.app.vanderbilt.edu/
- **Vanderbilt IT API Services** — VUIT Cloud Services integration and custom REST API development for faculty/staff (consulting service, not a public API product). Docs: https://it.vanderbilt.edu/services/catalog/infrastructure/middleware/application_program_interface_services.php

## Notes

Verification caveats (probed 2026-06-03):

- The official Vanderbilt GitHub org (`vanderbiltu`) exists but has zero public repositories.
- The Azure API Management developer portal endpoint did not resolve externally — it appears to be internal/network-gated, not openly self-service.
- VUIT "API Services" is a faculty/staff integration consulting offering, not a documented public API.
- The library runs Ex Libris Alma/Primo (which supports OAI-PMH and discovery APIs), and the Heard Libraries and Data Science Institute GitHub orgs host open code, but no Vanderbilt-specific public API documentation was confirmed.
- No endpoints were fabricated; entries reflect only what was confirmed by reference or live probe.
